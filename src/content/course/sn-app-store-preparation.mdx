You have built a working app. It compiles, it tests, it handles errors gracefully. Now comes the part that trips up more indie developers than any Swift compiler error: getting through App Review. This lesson is not about code — it is about everything around the code that determines whether your app actually reaches users.

We will set up App Store Connect, write an app description that sells, generate screenshot assets, create the privacy policy that Apple requires when your app calls an external API, and walk through the Review Guidelines checklist so your first submission does not bounce.

## What You'll Learn

- How to configure App Store Connect for a new app, including bundle ID registration, app icon requirements, and category selection
- How to use AI to write a compelling App Store description, subtitle, and keyword set that maximizes discoverability
- The privacy policy and data disclosure requirements for apps that send data to external APIs (OpenAI, in our case)
- A pre-submission checklist derived from the App Store Review Guidelines that catches the most common rejection reasons

## Why This Matters

Roughly 30% of first-time submissions get rejected. The most common reasons are not code bugs — they are missing metadata, incomplete privacy disclosures, and vague descriptions that confuse reviewers. Every day your app sits in "Rejected" status is a day you are not getting users. Getting this right on the first try is not perfectionism; it is time management.

## Plan Phase: Defining What We Build

Before touching App Store Connect, we need a plan for everything the submission requires. Open your AI tool in plan mode and send this prompt:

```
I am preparing to submit an iOS app called "BetAway" to the App Store.
The app is a free gambling recovery app for iOS that:
- Lets users log daily recovery check-ins with streak tracking
- Provides CBT-based therapy exercises and crisis intervention
- Includes guided breathing and financial recovery planning
- Uses on-device ML for recovery insights (offline-first, private)
- Stores data locally with SwiftData and optionally syncs via iCloud
- Targets iOS 17+, Swift 6

Help me plan the full App Store submission. Think through:
1. What do I need to set up in App Store Connect?
2. What metadata do I need (description, subtitle, keywords)?
3. What screenshot sizes and devices are required?
4. What privacy disclosures are needed given the OpenAI API usage?
5. What App Review Guidelines sections should I review carefully?
6. What do I need for a privacy policy URL?
7. What are the app icon specifications?

Do not generate any content yet. Give me the plan with a checklist.
```

### What the AI Plan Should Contain

A solid plan from this prompt will cover:

1. **App Store Connect setup** — registering a Bundle ID in the Apple Developer portal, creating a new app record, selecting the correct primary and secondary categories (Health & Fitness or Lifestyle).
2. **Metadata requirements** — app name (30 chars max), subtitle (30 chars max), description (4000 chars max), keywords (100 chars max, comma-separated), What's New text, support URL, marketing URL.
3. **Screenshot specifications** — required sizes for 6.7" (iPhone 15 Pro Max), 6.5" (iPhone 11 Pro Max), and optionally 5.5" (iPhone 8 Plus). iPad screenshots if you support iPad. At minimum 3 screenshots, maximum 10 per size class.
4. **Privacy disclosures** — App Privacy section must declare: data collected (recovery check-ins as Health & Fitness data), data shared with third parties (text sent to OpenAI for processing), data used for tracking (none, in our case).
5. **Review Guidelines flags** — Section 5.1 (Privacy), Section 1.1 (Objectionable Content — AI-generated responses need guardrails), Section 2.3 (Accurate Metadata), Section 5.1.2 (Data Use and Sharing), Section 1.4.1 (health/medical — BetAway discusses addiction recovery, which is a sensitive health topic).
6. **Privacy policy** — a hosted URL (GitHub Pages is fine) that discloses what data you collect, how the OpenAI API processes it, and user deletion rights.
7. **App icon** — single 1024x1024 PNG, no alpha channel, no rounded corners (the system applies them).

If the plan is missing privacy disclosures for the OpenAI API, push back. That is the number one reason AI-powered apps get rejected.

### Anti-Pattern: Submitting Blind

Here is what NOT to do:

```
Help me submit my app to the App Store
```

This prompt produces generic advice that misses everything specific to your app. It will not flag the OpenAI data disclosure. It will not mention the health-related content considerations. It will not tell you that "recovery tracking" as a keyword is more competitive than "recovery app." Without specifics, the AI gives you a checklist that applies to any app — and catches none of the things that will get *your* app rejected.

## Execute Phase: Implementation

### Step 1: App Store Connect Setup

Before generating content, handle the portal configuration. Here is the execution prompt:

```
Generate a step-by-step walkthrough for setting up BetAway in
App Store Connect. Include:

1. Bundle ID registration (com.yourname.betaway)
2. Creating the app record
3. Selecting categories (primary: Health & Fitness)
4. Setting up pricing (free with no in-app purchases for v1.0)
5. Age rating questionnaire answers for an app that:
   - Has no violence or mature content
   - Discusses gambling addiction (health/medical topic) but does NOT
     contain gambling content itself — it is a recovery tool
   - Does include "unrestricted web access" (API calls to OpenAI)
   - Includes user-generated content (recovery journal entries)
   - References health/medical topics (addiction recovery, CBT therapy)

Be specific about each field. I want to fill in the form without
guessing.
```

### Step 2: AI-Generated App Description

Now ask the AI to write your marketing copy:

```
Write the App Store metadata for BetAway, a free gambling recovery app
for iOS.

Generate:
1. App name (max 30 characters): "BetAway"
2. Subtitle (max 30 characters): something that communicates AI +
   recovery tracking concisely
3. Full description (max 4000 characters): use the problem-agitate-
   solve framework. Open with the user's pain point, explain why
   existing solutions fail, and position BetAway as the answer.
   Include 3-4 feature bullets. End with a call to action.
4. Keywords (max 100 characters, comma-separated): prioritize
   lower-competition long-tail keywords over generic terms
5. What's New text for v1.0: keep it simple and welcoming

Do not use ALL CAPS, excessive exclamation marks, or buzzwords like
"revolutionary." Write like a human, not a marketing bot.
```

### Analyzing the AI Output

**Subtitle:**

- ✅ Under 30 characters, communicates core value (e.g., "Free Gambling Recovery")
- ⚠️ If it repeats the app name — trim it. Apple penalizes keyword stuffing
- ❌ If it uses "Best" or "No. 1" — reject. Apple rejects superlatives you cannot prove

**Description:**

- ✅ Opens with a relatable pain point, not a feature list
- ✅ Uses short paragraphs and line breaks (walls of text get skimmed)
- ✅ Mentions privacy and data handling (builds trust)
- ⚠️ If it exceeds 4000 characters — trim. App Store Connect will reject it silently
- ❌ If it mentions competitor apps by name — reject. Violates guidelines
- ❌ If it makes health claims ("cures addiction," "treats depression") — reject immediately. Section 1.4.1 of the Review Guidelines prohibits medical claims without regulatory clearance. BetAway is a recovery *tool*, not a treatment

**Keywords:**

- ✅ Comma-separated, no spaces after commas (Apple counts spaces against the limit)
- ✅ Includes long-tail terms like "gambling-recovery,ai-diary,daily-recovery" instead of just "recoveryStatus"
- ❌ If it includes the app name or category name — remove. Apple already indexes those

### Step 3: Privacy Policy

```
Generate a privacy policy for BetAway that covers:

1. What data is collected: recovery check-ins (text, recovery status rating, date)
2. How data is stored: locally on device via SwiftData, optionally
   synced via iCloud (user-controlled)
3. Third-party data processing: check-in text is sent to OpenAI's
   API for insight generation. Include OpenAI's data usage policy
   reference.
4. Data retention: entries stay on device until user deletes them.
   OpenAI API data is not stored by us (reference OpenAI's zero
   data retention API policy)
5. User rights: users can delete all data from within the app
6. Contact information: placeholder email
7. Effective date: today's date

Format as a clean HTML page I can host on GitHub Pages.
```

## Iteration

After reviewing all the generated content, send this refinement prompt:

```
Review the App Store materials and tighten them up:

1. Trim the description to under 3500 characters to leave room for
   future updates
2. Rewrite the first sentence of the description — it needs to hook
   in under 10 words (that's all users see before "more")
3. Verify keywords total under 100 characters including commas
4. Add a "Data Linked to You" and "Data Not Linked to You" breakdown
   matching App Store Connect's privacy labels format
5. Confirm the privacy policy covers GDPR basics (right to deletion,
   data portability) even if we primarily target the US — Apple
   reviewers check this globally
```

## Verify Phase

Before you hit "Submit for Review," walk through every item:

**In App Store Connect:**
1. App icon uploaded — 1024x1024, no transparency, no rounded corners
2. Screenshots uploaded for all required device sizes (minimum: 6.7" and 6.5")
3. Description, subtitle, and keywords are filled and within character limits
4. Privacy policy URL is live and accessible (test it in an incognito browser)
5. App Privacy section completed — "Data Used to Track You: None," "Data Linked to You: Health & Fitness (Recovery check-ins)," "Data Shared with Third Parties: OpenAI for processing"
6. Age rating completed — marked "Unrestricted Web Access: Yes" and "Medical/Treatment Information: Yes" (the app discusses gambling addiction recovery as a health topic, though it does not contain gambling content itself)
7. Contact information and support URL are valid
8. Build uploaded via Xcode or Transporter

**On device:**
1. App tested on at least one physical device, not just the Simulator
2. Every feature shown in screenshots actually works in the build you uploaded
3. No placeholder text ("Lorem ipsum," "TODO," "Test") visible anywhere in the app
4. App does not crash on first launch, low memory, or interrupted network

**Privacy compliance:**
1. The app discloses the OpenAI API connection at first launch or in settings
2. Users can delete all their data from within the app
3. No data is collected before the user takes an action (no background tracking on launch)

## Final Code

This lesson's deliverables are configuration and content, not Swift code. Here are the key files you should have ready.

### Privacy Policy (HTML for GitHub Pages)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <h1>BetAway Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 22, 2026</p>

    <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        BetAway collects only the data you create: recovery check-ins consisting of
        a recovery status rating (1–5), optional text notes, and the date and time of
        the entry. We do not collect analytics, device identifiers, or
        location data.
    </p>

    <h2>How Data Is Stored</h2>
    <p>
        All recovery check-ins are stored locally on your device using Apple's
        SwiftData framework. If you enable iCloud sync, entries are also
        stored in your private iCloud container, which only you can access.
        We do not operate any servers that store your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Data Processing</h2>
    <p>
        When you use the "AI Insights" feature, the text of your check-in
        is sent to OpenAI's API for processing. OpenAI processes this data
        to generate personalized insights. We use OpenAI's zero data
        retention API endpoint, meaning your data is not stored by OpenAI
        after processing. For details, see
        <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies">
        OpenAI's API Data Usage Policies</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or behavioral tracking</li>
        <li>Contacts, photos, or other personal files</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        You can delete any or all recovery check-ins from within the app at any
        time. Deleting an entry removes it from your device and, if iCloud
        sync is enabled, from your iCloud container. You may also delete
        the app entirely, which removes all local data. To request a copy
        of your data or ask questions, contact us at the email below.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        BetAway is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly
        collect data from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. The updated version
        will be posted at this URL with a new effective date.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>

### Screenshot Generation Script (Optional)

If you want to automate screenshot capture for multiple device sizes, add this UI test to your test target:

```swift
import XCTest

final class ScreenshotTests: XCTestCase {
    private let app = XCUIApplication()

    override func setUpWithError() throws {
        continueAfterFailure = false
        app.launch()
    }

    /// Captures screenshots for App Store submission.
    @MainActor
    func testCaptureAppStoreScreenshots() throws {
        // Screenshot 1: Home screen with recovery check-ins
        let homeAttachment = XCTAttachment(screenshot: app.screenshot())
        homeAttachment.name = "01-HomeScreen"
        homeAttachment.lifetime = .keepAlways
        add(homeAttachment)

        // Screenshot 2: New check-in
        let newEntryButton = app.buttons["New Entry"]
        if newEntryButton.waitForExistence(timeout: 3) {
            newEntryButton.tap()
            sleep(1)
            let entryAttachment = XCTAttachment(screenshot: app.screenshot())
            entryAttachment.name = "02-NewEntry"
            entryAttachment.lifetime = .keepAlways
            add(entryAttachment)
        }

        // Screenshot 3: AI Insights
        app.navigationBars.buttons.element(boundBy: 0).tap()
        sleep(1)
        let insightsTab = app.buttons["Insights"]
        if insightsTab.waitForExistence(timeout: 3) {
            insightsTab.tap()
            sleep(1)
            let insightsAttachment = XCTAttachment(screenshot: app.screenshot())
            insightsAttachment.name = "03-AIInsights"
            insightsAttachment.lifetime = .keepAlways
            add(insightsAttachment)
        }
    }
}
```

Run this test with `xcodebuild test` for each simulator device to collect all required screenshot sizes. Xcode saves the attachments in the test results bundle.

## Checkpoint

Before moving to Lesson 8.2, confirm every item:

- [ ] Apple Developer account is active and enrolled in the Apple Developer Program
- [ ] Bundle ID registered in the Apple Developer portal
- [ ] App record created in App Store Connect with correct bundle ID
- [ ] App icon (1024x1024, no alpha) added to Assets.xcassets
- [ ] App Store description written, under 4000 characters, no health claims
- [ ] Subtitle written, under 30 characters, no keyword stuffing
- [ ] Keywords set, under 100 characters, comma-separated without spaces after commas
- [ ] Screenshots captured for at least 6.7" and 6.5" device sizes
- [ ] Privacy policy hosted at a publicly accessible URL
- [ ] App Privacy section completed in App Store Connect with OpenAI data disclosure
- [ ] Age rating questionnaire completed with "Unrestricted Web Access: Yes" and health/medical content flagged (gambling addiction recovery)
- [ ] App tested on at least one physical device
- [ ] No placeholder text, debug code, or `TODO` comments visible in the shipped build

## Challenge

**Write an alternative App Store description targeting a different audience.**

Your current description targets general users. Rewrite it for a specific niche: college students dealing with academic stress.

1. Use the same problem-agitate-solve structure
2. Open with a pain point specific to students (exam stress, burnout, irregular schedules)
3. Keep it under 3500 characters
4. Adjust the keywords to target this audience (add "student-recovery,exam-stress,college-wellbeing")
5. Verify the new keywords still total under 100 characters

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

The best App Store descriptions speak directly to one person, not everyone. Starting with "Between midterms and finals..." immediately signals to students that this app was built for them. Generic descriptions try to appeal to everyone and end up resonating with no one.

Here is a strong opening line to build from:

"Between lectures, deadlines, and late nights, your mental health is the first thing that slips. BetAway catches it before you do."

Notice: no health claims ("reduces stress"), no superlatives ("best app"), no competitor mentions. Just a relatable scenario and a clear value proposition.
</details>
