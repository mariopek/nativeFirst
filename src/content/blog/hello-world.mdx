We are NativeFirst, a small indie studio dedicated to building native apps for Apple platforms. No cross-platform frameworks, no Electron wrappers -- just pure Swift and SwiftUI, crafted to feel right at home on your Mac, iPhone, and iPad.

## What We Build

Our focus is on creating tools that are thoughtful, fast, and respectful of your privacy. Every app we ship is built from the ground up using Apple's native technologies, because we believe that is how you deliver the best possible user experience.

Right now we have two apps in the pipeline:

- **Invoize** -- A macOS invoicing app that lets freelancers and small businesses create beautiful, professional invoices in seconds. No subscriptions, no cloud dependency. Your data stays on your machine.
- **ThinkBud** -- An iOS learning companion powered by AI. Mind maps, flash cards, quizzes, and smart summaries to help you master any topic.

## What This Blog Will Cover

We started this blog to share what we learn along the way. Expect posts on:

- **App Development** -- Practical guides and lessons from building production apps with Swift and SwiftUI.
- **AI Integration** -- How we use machine learning and large language models inside our apps to create smarter features.
- **Vibe Coding** -- Our take on the development workflow, tooling, and the creative side of writing software.
- **Apple Platform Deep Dives** -- Tips on working with macOS, iOS, and the broader Apple ecosystem.

## Why We Share

Building software in the open makes us better developers. Writing about the problems we solve forces us to understand them more deeply, and if our posts help someone else along the way, that is a win for everyone.

We are excited to have you here. Stay tuned for more posts, and feel free to reach out through our [contact page](/contact) if you want to chat.

Happy coding.
